# Write a program to illustrate Method overriding in python.
  create classes called SBI and ICICI, ICICI is child class of SBI.
  create a method called rateOfInterest() in SBI and ICICI classes.


class SBI:
    # declare variables called principal, rate, time and rate_of_Interest


    # define a method called setSBI(principal,rate,time) and assigne local variable values to instance varaibles



    # define a method called rateOfInterest() and write the logic to calculate rate of interest


class ICICI(SBI):
    # declare variables called principal, rate, time and rate_of_Interest


    # define a method called setSBI(principal,rate,time) and assigne local variable values to instance varaibles



    # define a method called rateOfInterest() and write the logic to calculate rate of interest




# Take input from user and create object for SBI and ICICI classes and display the rate of interest for SBI and ICICI
